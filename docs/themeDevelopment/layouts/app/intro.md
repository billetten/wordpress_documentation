The generel layout used to make it easier to make new pages. 
The layout holds the header and the footer, so you don't have to implement them every time. 

The app layout have 3 sections. 

- content
- above_content
- below_content


#### content 
This is the main content, where you place all the default content. This section is wrapped in a x-container. 


#### above_content / below_content 
These sections is made out of a container and placed above and below the main content. So if you want to make a page, where the main content should be in a container, but you have something which doesn't need to be in a container, then these are usefull. But you don't need to use or define them.
