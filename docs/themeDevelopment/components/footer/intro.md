The Header is a component, where there is made some pre-defined types. 
If none of the types match what you need, you can make a custom one. 

The custome lays in: **resources/views/layouts/footer/custom.blade.php**

You can call the file what ever you want, just in case you need more than one header in a project. 

See [example of custom footer](themeDevelopment/examples/index?id=custom-footer-exampel)
