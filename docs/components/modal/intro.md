This is the modal component. 

It can be used in many different ways. There is an option to use it for videos, pictures or normal content. 

When using this for media, remember to add a class for the button / thumbnail it self. 
The button / thumbnail isn't styled, so you need to that your self. 
That means the thumbnail will have a height off 0 from start, and therefor can't be seen.
